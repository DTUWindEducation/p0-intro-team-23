1. Git is a version control system that allows developers to keep track of changes made to their code over time, while GitLab is a web-based Git repository manager. 
2. GitHub is popular for open-source projects and community collaboration, with strong third-party integrations. GitLab offers a comprehensive DevOps suite with built-in CI/CD, while Bitbucket excels in integration with Atlassian tools like Jira.
3. One might choose to use Git without GitLab if they want to host their repositories on a different platform, like GitHub or Bitbucket, or if they prefer to self-host their own Git server.
4. To update your GitLab server, commit your local changes with git add . and git commit -m "message", then push them using git push origin <branch>. Make sure to pull the latest changes from the server first using git pull to avoid conflicts.
5. A branch in Git is a separate line of development that allows you to work on features, fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase.
